ðŸ§  RAG Agent Front-End
This is the front-end interface for interacting with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by OpenAI. It allows users to input natural language questions, which are then processed and answered based on contextually relevant data extracted from PDF documents.

ðŸ”§ Features
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for asking questions and viewing answers in real time.

API Integration: Connects seamlessly with the backend RAG agent via RESTful API calls built with FastAPI.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices to ensure accessibility.

ðŸ§© How It Works
Users input a question through the front-end.

The question is sent to the backend RAG agent via an API call.

The backend processes the query, performs context-aware retrieval from a vector database (MongoDB + HuggingFace embeddings), and sends the relevant data to OpenAI for response generation.

The answer is returned to the front-end and displayed instantly to the user.
